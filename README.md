# Forecasting Demand of Primary Health Care inLebanon: insight from the Syrian Refugee Crisis

Lebanon has been hosting the largest number of refugees per capita in the world.The spillover from surrounding conflicts and particularly the Syrian conflict hasbeen overstretching Lebanon’s infrastructure on multiple levels, including medicalservices. In this manuscript, we address the problems of pointwise as well asprobabilistic forecasting of demand on primary health care centers from the years 2014-2016 on the departments of General Medicine, Gynecology, Pediatrics,Pharmacy, in the Akkar, Beqaa, and Tripoli governorates,known to havebeen hosting the largest proportion of refugees. In our analysis wepursue evidence whether the spatio-temporal surge in demand can be linked topeaks in the Syrian war captured by the burden of war on civilians as well asproximity of the affected areas in Syria to the named governorates in Lebanon.We frame our daily, one-step, multivariate time series forecasting problem as asupervised (regression) machine learning problem, for which we develop a suite ofstatistical and machine learning models to predict demand as a function of such“shock events” and other ancillary data including weather parameters. Ourresulting regression problem is imbalanced, consisting of a significantly lesserthough highly relevant number representing peaks in demand. As such, we honeit using techniques from utility based regression, particularly, the SMOGN artificial oversampling technique,where rare values representing surge indemand are artificially oversampled in order to improve thelearning process. We finally subject our models to SHAP (SHapley AdditiveexPlanation) in order to reveal the rules driving their predictions and to analyzethe importance of individual features. Our exploratory data analysis reveals aclose association between peaks in demand and the features representing civiliancasualties as well as proximity from affected Syrian regions to respective Lebanesegovernorates where the peak is observed. Our best performing models can delivera pointwise prediction
